# so here the the practice of our project


#the name stand for the workflow name and 
# A workflow is composed of:
#         Triggers → when it runs actually is on push or pull request
#         Jobs → independent units of work we define using YAML
#         Steps → shell commands inside a job define the sequence of tasks to be performed
#         Runners → the machine (Linux, macOS, Windows) that runs the job in gitHub-hosted or self-hosted environment


name: Webserv CI/CD Pipeline

#here we define the trigger for the workflow
# In this case the workflow will be triggered on push or pull request events to the main or master branches
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - master
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
      - master

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

# the uses s a github action that it authenticates with gitHub
#Runs git clone of your repository
#Checks out the correct branch / commit Places the code in: /home/runner/work/<repository-name>/<repository-name>

      - name: Set up java environment
        uses: actions/setup-java@v2
        with:
          java-version: '17'
          distribution: 'temurin'
          cache: 'maven' #the actual work of it is to cache the maven dependencies in the workflow in the path ~/.m2/repository
          cache-dependency-path: 'webserv/pom.xml' #specifies the path to the pom.xml file(s) in the repository 
    # now i need to enter the webserv directory to run the maven commands
      - name: Build with Maven
        working-directory: ./webserv
        run: make build
      #need to add test later on

      - name: Clean project
        working-directory: ./webserv
        if : always()  # This ensures that the cleanup step runs regardless of previous step outcomes
        run: make fclean
